The assignment for the fundamentals of data analysis 2018

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the assignment for the fundamentals of data analysis module. It is divided into four sections:

- **Background of the dataset** : The Anscome's Quartet is introduced with speculation on how such a dataset can be created.
- **Descriptive Statistics** : The descriptive statistics of the dataset are calculated using numpy and pandas. 
- **Plots** : The dataset is plotted with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Conclusion** : The results of the plots and statistics are contrasted and conclusions for the discrepancies are suggested.

I would suggest that you run the notebook from top to bottom in order. If you encounter any problems: 

1. Run the cell immediately above - there may be a return needed from here to run your current cell.
2. If that fails, go back to the top of the notebook and run the cell which imports numpy and the other required packages. 
3. Finally, you may have to close the notebook, kill jupyter notebook on the command line and restart it.
